2mm and 2.5mm thick "washers" used to engage the ratchet on a Husky
701 timing chain tensioner.

The shop manual calls for a set of washers between 2mm and 2.5 mm.
I thought that a somewhat captive washer was a lot easier to use than
trying to balance between 2 washers.

I tried both and either will lock the tensioner at the required 3mm
length. So print and use either one.

I printed with PLA at 100% infill to resist any compression (not sure that
lower infill would be an issue, but why chance it on such small piece)
